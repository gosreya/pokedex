# pokedex

You were busy ---- when suddenly---

a wild Pikachu appeared! Luckily you have **pokedex**, your personal command line guidebook to all the Pokémon you'll encounter on your fabulous adventures.

To run the Pokedex on your command line interface, all you have do is download the 'pokedex' folder and put it somewhere convenient. Make an alias for executing pokedex.py for easy access (e.g. alias pokedex="/usr/local/bin/pokedex/pokedex.py").

Now, just call "pokedex \<pokemon\>". Don't know how to spell the Pokemon's name? Not to worry, the pokedex has a built in spell correction!



Call "pokedex --update" or "pokedex -u" to retrieve the latest Pokémon data from the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/).

Or use the Pokedex w/ no hassle on [Replit](https://replit.com/@SreyaGogineni1/POKEDEX#main.py) (Just click 'Run').
